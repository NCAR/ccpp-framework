# CCPP Framework

This repository contains the Common Community Physics Package (CCPP) Framework: The infrastructure that connects CCPP physics schemes with a host model, as well as stand-alone tools for use with CCPP.

## Documentation
The CCPP Framework is designed to be used with the [CCPP Physics repository](https://github.com/NCAR/ccpp-physics) and a host model. Links to further information about this repository and its place in the context of the CCPP as a whole can be found on the [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/NCAR/ccpp-framework/wiki).

The CCPP Single Column Model (SCM) is designed as a simple host model for testing and development of the CCPP; information about building and using the CCPP in this context can be found in [the CCPP SCM Users Guide](https://dtcenter.org/sites/default/files/paragraph/scm-ccpp-guide-v6.0.0.pdf).

More information about the design and use of CCPP can be found in the [CCPP Technical Documentation](https://ccpp-techdoc.readthedocs.io/en/v6.0.0/).
