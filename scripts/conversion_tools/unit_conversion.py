"""A pilot version to perform unit conversions. Each conversion must be representable
as a formula where {var} is substituted by the actual variable (scalar, array) to convert,
and {kind} by either _ followed by the kind of the variable, or an emptry string.
This allows having formulars such as func({var}) where func is defined as an elemental
function or as an interface to scalar and array-based functions that perform more
complex conversions than the ones listed here. It is also possible, but in some cases
less performant, to construct conversions for composed units by combining some of the
basic conversions listed here. For instance, one could create a speed conversion from
km h-1 to m s-1 by combining the formulas for km to m and h to min, which will be
slower than boiling it down to a single mathematical expression (see example below)."""
